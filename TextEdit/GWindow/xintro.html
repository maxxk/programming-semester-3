<h1>A Brief intro to X11 Programming</h1>
<HR>

This is meant to be a simple overview of X11 programming.  It will contain 
the basics necessary to create a single window X program.  All of the 
information of this will pertain simply to programming with the X11 
libraries which come standard with X11R[5/6].  It goes without saying, 
but this page is under constuction at all times.

<H2><A NAME = "over">Overview of X11 Programming</a></H2>
X is a fun-filled graphical system for most flavors of UNIX.  There are 
many toolkits for programming X, but learning to use the X Library calls 
is a tried and true method which yields highly portable code.  This 
document is meant to be a short introduction to some of the things I have 
learned about it myself.  It will probably always remain "under 
construction".  Strap yourself in and hold on!  This train's bound for 
glory, this train's coming through and one of these days these trains are 
going to walk all over you!
<P><P>

<H2><A name = "include">Header Files for X</A></H2>
Here are the header files required to do much of anything in X.  The 
order <b>is</b> important:
<pre>
		#include &ltX11/Xlib.h&gt
		#include &ltX11/Xutil.h&gt
		#include &ltX11/Xos.h&gt
</pre>
These files can typically be found in /usr/include/X11.  I highly 
recommend looking though the header files themselves, but don't get 
caught up on trying to figure out everything at once!  The best way to 
learn them is to continually consult them as you continue to work with X.
<P><P>

<H2><A name = "vars">Important X Variables</A></H2>
X has a number of important variables for handling windows:
<PRE>
		Display *dis;
		int screen;
		Window win;
		GC gc;
</PRE>
The display points to the X Server.  The screen refers to which screen of 
the display to use.  Setting up the connection from the X Client to the X 
Server typically involves a line like:  setenv DISPLAY 
my.machine.where.ever:0.  The my.machine.where.ever is tied in with the 
Display* and the screen is connected with the :0 part of the variable.  
The Window controls the actual window itself (duh! ;^).  And the GC is 
the graphics context.<p>
The graphics context has a lot to do with how things are displayed/drawn 
in the window.  Different masks can be set, etc. and you can get pretty 
funky with it.<p>
Typically calls to get input and output to the window use one or more of 
the above variables.  See the appropriate sections for details.<p>
Here is a simple routine to create a simple X Windows.  It assumes that
the above variable have been declared globally:
<PRE>
void init_x() {
	/* get the colors black and white (see section for details) */
	unsigned long black,white;

	/* use the information from the environment variable DISPLAY 
	   to create the X connection:
	*/	
	dis=XOpenDisplay((char *)0);
   	screen=DefaultScreen(dis);
	black=BlackPixel(dis,screen),	/* get color black */
	white=WhitePixel(dis, screen);  /* get color white */

	/* once the display is initialized, create the window.
	   This window will be have be 200 pixels across and 300 down.
	   It will have the foreground white and background black
	*/
   	win=XCreateSimpleWindow(dis,DefaultRootWindow(dis),0,0,	
		200, 300, 5, white, black);

	/* here is where some properties of the window can be set.
	   The third and fourth items indicate the name which appears
	   at the top of the window and the name of the minimized window
	   respectively.
	*/
	XSetStandardProperties(dis,win,"My Window","HI!",None,NULL,0,NULL);

	/* this routine determines which types of input are allowed in
	   the input.  see the appropriate section for details...
	*/
	XSelectInput(dis, win, ExposureMask|ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask);

	/* create the Graphics Context */
        gc=XCreateGC(dis, win, 0,0);        

	/* here is another routine to set the foreground and background
	   colors _currently_ in use in the window.
	*/
	XSetBackground(dis,gc,white);
	XSetForeground(dis,gc,black);

	/* clear the window and bring it on top of the other windows */
	XClearWindow(dis, win);
	XMapRaised(dis, win);
};
</PRE>
This section is really only about 10 lines of code if you take out all of 
the goofy comments, and it can be reused with only minor modifications 
over and over.  Some may object to the "cut-and-paste" method of reusing 
code, but it works...  This snippet of code will pop up an X Window on 
your default server.  Most of the calls have a lot of functionality, but 
this is enough to get you started.<p>
Another important task is closing the window correctly:
<PRE>
void close_x() {
/* it is good programming practice to return system resources to the 
   system...
*/
	XFreeGC(dis, gc);
	XDestroyWindow(dis,win);
	XCloseDisplay(dis);	
	exit(1);				
}
</PRE><P>
For more information about the routines above, see the following sections 
(where applicable) and/or try the man pages.  They are a great resource.
<P><P>

<H2><A name = "input">Handling Input</A></H2>
Input in X is "event driven".  This is a big fancy-pants word given 
to programs which wait for stuff to happpen before doing stuff.  Here is 
a very simple event driven program:
<PRE>
	main () {
		char tmp[512];
		while (1) {
			scanf("%s",tmp);
			printf("%s",tmp);
		}
	}
</PRE>
As you can see, "event driven" programming is nothing new or special.  
The way that events are handled in X is, however, a bit on the fun side.
Basicly you have an XEvent.  This can be keypress, mouse button 
press/release, mouse movement, etc.  Anything which can be used as input 
to an X Window.<P>
How can one variable handle all these different types of events you ask?  
The answer is that it is a big, complex structure!  <blink>Don't be 
afraid!</blink>  Even though it is big and scary, you don't have to 
learn every aspect of it to use it.<p>
The key concepts to using the XEvent structure are:
<OL>
<LI>setting up the input masks
<LI>creating an instance of the XEvent
<LI>checking for events
<LI>handling events.
</OL><P>

Here is code snippet which gives an example of using XEvent's.  It 
assumes that a call has been made to init_x() (see previous section) 
where the call:  
<PRE>
	XSelectInput(dis, win, ExposureMask|ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask)
</PRE>
was made.  This call sets up the masks.  Now only Expose, ButtonPress and
KeyPress events are regarded as valid.  The Expose event type refers to when
a portion of the window which had been obscured by another window becomes 
visisble again.  This is usually handled by some sort of user routine to
repaint the window.  Note:  the redraws must be handle <b>by the user</b>!
The below example assumes a routine redraw() has been written.  Also 
notice how the KeyPress event is handled.  Pressing a 'q' will exit the 
program.

<PRE>
	XEvent event;		/* the XEvent declaration !!! */
	KeySym key;		/* a dealie-bob to handle KeyPress Events */	
	char text[255];		/* a char buffer for KeyPress Events */

	/* look for events forever... */
	while(1) {		
		/* get the next event and stuff it into our event variable.
		   Note:  only events we set the mask for are detected!
		*/
		XNextEvent(dis, &event);
	
		if (event.type==Expose && event.xexpose.count==0) {
		/* the window was exposed redraw it! */
			redraw();
		}
		if (event.type==KeyPress&&
		    XLookupString(&event.xkey,text,255,&key,0)==1) {
		/* use the XLookupString routine to convert the invent
		   KeyPress data into regular text.  Weird but necessary...
		*/
			if (text[0]=='q') {
				close_x();
			}
			printf("You pressed the %c key!\n",text[0]);
		}
		if (event.type==ButtonPress) {
		/* tell where the mouse Button was Pressed */
			printf("You pressed a button at (%i,%i)\n",
				event.xbutton.x,event.xbutton.y);
		}
	}
};
</PRE>
The printf statements will, of course, print to terminal you ran the X 
program from.<p>

There are a lot of Event types and masks.  Read the man pages on:  
XSelectInput and XNextEvent for more information.  Also see 
/usr/include/X11 and search for NoEventMask.  This will give you a 
complete list of all the different sorts of events there are.  It is 
worth noting that XNextEvent will block until another event comes 
through.  So if no events occur, your program just sits there.  
XCheckWindowEvent is similar to 
XNextEvent (though it takes different arguments), but it returns a true 
(1) or a false (0) about whether or not an event occured.  If an event 
did occur it fills an XEvent structure with info about the event.  In 
either case, the program execution continues unabated.

<H2><a name ="draw">Drawing in the Window</a></H2>
Now that you have a nice spiffy windows up, and it can accept input, the 
next step is to respond with output!  Here are some basics to get you 
started:
<UL>
<LI>XDrawLine(dis,win,gc, x1,y1, x2,y2);
<LI>XDrawArc(dis,win,gc,x,y, width, height, arc_start, arc_stop); 
<LI>XDrawRectangle(dis, win, gc, x, y, width, height)  
<LI>XFillArc(dis,win, gc, x, y, width, height, arc_start, arc_stop);
<LI>XFillRectangle(dis,win,gc, x, y, width, height);     
</UL>
Note:  I using the notation that the variables:
<PRE>
		Display *dis;
		Window win;
		GC gc;
</PRE>
have been declared and initialized (ala init_x()).  All of these calls 
are pretty straight forward, but a look at the man pages will give you more
useful information.  By appending an 's' to the end of each of the above 
you can get routines to draw more than one of the same (e.g.:  
XDrawArcs(...)).  Something to keep in mind, is that anything that is
drawn uses the current foreground and background colors.  See Working 
with Colors for more info!
<P><P>

<H2><a name = "text">Placing Text in the Window</a></H2>
Placing text in a window is very similar to drawing in a window.  The 
routine to remember is:
<PRE>
	XDrawString(dis,win,gc,x,y, string, strlen(string));
</PRE>
Pretty simple, huh?  There are other string routines, which you can learn 
about by consulting the man page for 
XDrawString.
<P><P>


<H2><A name = "colors">Working with Colors</A></H2>
Colors can get pretty complicated.  In the interest of simplicity, I will 
assume that you are working with a display which can handle the standard 
256 colors (e.g.:  SVGA).  With X it is possible to sense the type of 
display and adjust the color routines appropriately, but why worry about 
that?  If you are writing some serious application and you are concerned 
about interoperability (EGA, CGA, TrueColor, Real Color, etc) then read the 
man pages like a big boy/girl.<p>

Ahem, now on with the discussion.  For the purpose of this introduction I 
am going to stick with two basic ideas:  shared and private colormaps.  
Colormaps is another word for palettes.  I am only going to talk about 
256 color colormaps.<P>
<I>Getting the colors you want from a shared colormap</i> is really 
pretty simple.  The easiest way is to consult the rgb.txt file (usually 
found as /usr/X11/lib/X11/rgb.txt).  It list all the string names 
associated with all the colors of the rainbow!  Here is how you use them:
<PRE>
void get_colors() {
	XColor tmp;

	XParseColor(dis, DefaultColormap(dis,screen), "chartreuse", &tmp);
	XAllocColor(dis,DefaultColormap(dis,screen),&tmp);
	chartreuse=tmp.pixel;
};
</PRE>
Once again, this routine assumes you have called the init_x() routine.  
It also assumes chartreuse is a globally declared unsigned long int to 
hold the pixel value which refers to the closest match to chartreuse in 
the current palette.  As you can probably imagine, you don't always get 
exactly what you ask for.  This is why many application use a private 
colormap (or have it as an option).<P>
<I>Creating a private colormap</I> is a bit more involved, but if you 
want the colors to be perfect in your window, it is the easiest way.
<PRE>
void create_colormap() {
	int i;
	Colormap cmap;
	XColor tmp[255];

	for(i=0;i<255;i++) {
		tmp[i].pixel=i;
		tmp[i].flags=DoRed|DoGreen|DoBlue;
		tmp[i].red=i*256;
		tmp[i].blue=i*256;
		tmp[i].green=i*256;
	}	
	cmap=XCreateColormap(dis,RootWindow(dis,screen),
		DefaultVisual(dis,screen),AllocAll);
	XStoreColors(dis, cmap, tmp,255);
	XSetWindowColormap(dis,win,cmap);
}
</PRE>
This initializes an array of 256 XColors into which we store the RGB 
values, set the pixel and flag values.  Then the colormap is created 
(note:  the funky call to DefaultVisual, is a clue about how to handle 
different display types ;^).  Next the colors are loaded into the 
colormap and finally the colormap is set for our window.  If you set up a 
private colormap, you may also want to add a line like:  
XFreeColormap(dis,cmap); to your close_x() routine.<p>
Now that your know how to get the pixel values for the color you want 
(either with a share colormap or private), here is what you can do with 
this information:
<PRE>
	XSetForeground(dis,gc,chartreuse);
        XDrawArc(dis,win,gc,x,1, 17,17,0,23040);
</PRE>
You basicly use the pixel value to set the foreground (or background) 
color and then draw in the color of your choice!  What could be simpler?
<P><P>

<H2><A name = "compile">Compiling your Code</A></H2>
Now for the fun part.  Compiling your code!  Let's say you have written 
an X program called hi.c.  In it you placed the #include lines with care 
in hope that a window soon would appear!  What you do to compile it 
depends on how your system is setup.  Try each of the following until 
you find which one(s) will work for you.  I have listed them in order of 
commonality:
<OL>
<LI>gcc hi.c -o hi -lX11
<LI>gcc hi.c -o hi -I /usr/include/X11 -L /usr/X11/lib -lX11
<LI>gcc hi.c -o hi -I /sowhere/else -L /who/knows/where -lX11
</OL>
OK, I admit the third one is wacky, but it is meant to indicate that the 
-lX11 flag by itself was not sufficient and that the file X.h is not in 
/usr/include/X11 and that libX11.so was not in /usr/X11/lib.  In this 
case you will need to find them, install them, have them installed, or 
give up like a lamer!  Try using whereis and find to locate them (maybe 
locate too...).<p>
Before running your program don't forget to set your DISPLAY environment 
variable!  In csh:  setenv DISPLAY my.ip.number.here:0.  In others try:  
DISPLAY=my.ip.number.here:0; export DISPLAY.

<H2><A name = "end">Conclusions</A></H2>
This document is a very basic introduction.  This is its first draft 
(2/9/96).  I hope to add more information (XImage, .xbm files, cursors, 
etc) when I have more time later.  As I continue my own process of 
learning X, I hope to expand these pages further.<p>
<a href="hi.c">Here</a> is a very simple sample program for your to try out.<p>
